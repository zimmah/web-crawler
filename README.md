# web-crawler

## Ideas for extending the project
* Make the script run on a timer and deploy it to a server. Have it email you every so often with a report
* Add more robust error checking so that you can crawl larger sites without issues
* Count external links, as well as internal links, and add them to the report
* Save the report as a CSV spreadsheet rather than printing it to the console
* Use a graphics library to create an image that shows the links between the pages as a graph visualization
* Make requests concurrently to speed up the crawling process
* Add a README.md file explaining to users how to clone your git repo and get started
